 Yeah, slimedemidemislime Sabi mo, "Just come over" (ya already know)
I said, "Just give me a moment, " oh-oh
'Ga't pagkikita natin napapadalas
Hinahatid-sundo mo pa 'ko sa tapat
Kahit hindi naman dapat
Halik pa'ng pasasalamat
First, I was good with you being my homebody
When we're blacked out, my sofa is your body
'Til I no longer wanna be just your shawty
And I only want nobody but you
First, I was good with you being my homebody
When we're blacked out, my sofa is your body
'Til I no longer wanna be just your shawty
And I only want nobody but you (yeah, yeah), nobody but you
I'll slide kahit late night
Hindi ko din alam kung ano'ng pakay
Pati pa'no sumakay, kami same flight
Kung 'di pa nga hahawakan 'yong kamay ko'y
Malamang ay iwan na ako nang eight mile
Pati mga bilin sa sarili na mag-ingat
Nalimutan, nawala, 'di na same vibe
Uh-huh, yeah, you know I won't waste time
Sana 'di ka umalis (yuh)
'Si kung nandiyan ka, papunta na ako, uh
Kung mayro'ng plano, kainis
Desisyon mo, baka puwede pang magbago
Alam ko naman na ayaw mo na rin ng stress
Kasi sino ba naman ako para manggago?
Mga pangyayari sa paligid mabilis
Pero 'lam kong 'di 'to basta-basta maglalaho, yeah
First, I was good with you being my homebody
When we're blacked out, my sofa is your body
'Til I no longer wanna be just your shawty
And I only want nobody but you (and I only want nobody but you)
First, I was good with you being my homebody
When we're blacked out, my sofa is your body
'Til I no longer wanna be just your shawty
And I only want nobody but you, nobody but you
